# Particle Simulator

## Overview
Welcome to the Particle Simulator project! This simulator is designed to create and visualize complex particle systems governed by real physics. It supports various states of matter including powder, liquid, solid, and gas, and allows for the simulation of phenomena such as explosions, nuclear reactions, fusion, fission, and particle collisions.

## Features
- **Particle Dynamics**: Simulate individual particle motion with accurate physics.
- **State Transitions**: Model transitions between different states of matter.
- **Interactions**: Implement interactions between particles, including collisions and forces.
- **Explosions and Reactions**: Simulate explosive reactions and nuclear processes.
- **Visualization**: Visualize the particle systems in 2D with clear and informative graphics.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- `numpy` and `matplotlib` packages

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ParticleSimulator.git
