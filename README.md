# ParticleSimulator
Welcome to the Particle Simulator project! This simulator is designed to create and visualize complex particle systems governed by real physics. It supports various states of matter including powder, liquid, solid, and gas, and allows for the simulation of phenomena such as explosions, nuclear reactions, fusion, fission, and particle collisions.
